		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do
			for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health,
			help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and
			muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities. Adults who
			sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain
			some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact
			on your health as physical activity. Everyone can experience the health
			benefits of physical activity â€“ age, abilities, ethnicity, shape, or size
			do not matter.
